## AIâ€™s impact on revenue cycle management

Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) has recently become a focal point for those harnessing AI to disrupt healthcare.
Most startups in this space have predominantly concentrated on three key areas:
- Improving medical coding (Fathom, Nym, Diagnoss)
- Streamlining claims processing (advata, Outbound)
- Pursuing unpaid claims (true claim)

While each of these aspects holds its own significance, implementing piecemeal solutions into healthcare institutions proves challenging. Resistance to adopting tech solutions on a large scale is a common obstacle. Additionally, it seems that many of these solutions miss the bigger picture, which is medical documentation.
An ideal solution seamlessly integrates documentation, coding, and billing. After all, delays in claims often result from documentation inaccuracies or inefficiencies in the payer process, which providers cannot control. Insurance companies often have a vested interest in delaying claims to safeguard their cash flow. 

Therefore, solutions primarily targeting providers are likely to have limited impact, as payers tend to find alternative ways to delay claims processing (such as pre-authorizations).
An integrated solution that manages the documentation process offers the potential to:
- Reduce provider burnout.
- Ensure the accuracy of claim structures.
  
If a claim is delayed because a provider failed to document the appropriate Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG), no piecemeal solution can rectify the situation. There are some promising startups, like Juniper, that have made strides in specific areas, such as psychiatry, by combining documentation and claims processing. Juniper goes a step further by offering advanced payouts to alleviate the burden on cash flow.
On the documentation front, startups like Abridge, Nuance, Deepscribe have taken the first steps in clinical documentation for provider clinics. OpenAI has also begun integrating with large hospital systems. However, a potential gap exists in "in-patient" settings, which lack the margins (already low in hospitals). Skilled nursing presents a prime example for any documentation or billing player looking to enter this market.
Firstly, the market demand in skilled nursing is substantial because it lacks the extensive teams found in hospital settings. Often, a single provider handles both documentation and patient care, unlike the medical rounds conducted in hospitals. 

Furthermore, solutions like Syllable cannot easily integrate into in-patient settings, as in-patient hospitals do not typically require documentation startups due to their larger team sizes.
In terms of integration, a significant 80% of the market uses PointClickCare as their Electronic Health Record (EHR), meaning that serving one client can lead to rapid scalability. Finally, documentation is even more critical for skilled nursing than for hospitals because, in addition to billing purposes, it also affects star ratings, ultimately impacting the bottom line in the future.
