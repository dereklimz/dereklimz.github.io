## AI in Clinical Medicine

When delving into the world of start-ups focused on enhancing clinical outcomes, I like to break it down into three key categories: 
- Patient consultation
- Diagnosis or prediction
- Management. 

Patient consultation often revolves around telemedicine platforms that facilitate provider matching, as well as other remote patient monitoring solutions like Cardiogram for heart disease.


Diagnosis, prediction, and early detection frequently entail harnessing AI to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of specific diagnostic processes. This is most commonly seen in medical imaging with companies like Dermpath, Harrison.ai, and PathAI. But AI is making inroads into other conditions as well, such as End-Stage Kidney Disease (ESKD) with CloudCath.


In the realm of management, there's a rising trend in self-guided management solutions. Examples include Woebot, ginger.io, physiotherapy apps)


When it comes to patient consultation, the concept only makes sense if there's an adequate supply of healthcare providers to match with patients. I've come across numerous telepsychiatry matching platforms that, in my view, won't stand the test of time. The problem often lies in the fact that patient needs don't align with the availability of providers. It's akin to creating a restaurant matching platform when there are only two restaurants in your area. The more significant fix should focus on addressing the provider supply issue. One interesting approach I've observed in psychiatry is a focus on less acute patients who require counseling rather than therapy. Supportiv.AI is intriguing in this regard because it addresses the "supply" problem by utilizing peer support for individuals with similar conditions.


Regarding diagnosis, improving diagnostic accuracy is beneficial primarily in terms of enhancing the workflow of healthcare providers. We haven't reached a stage where any diagnostic AI tool can replace providers entirely, unless companies are willing to accept medical liability. The final decision should always rest with providers who assume legal liability for their decisions.  In a similar vein, start-ups that leverage predictive analytics are most useful when the predictions lead to actionable outcomes. For instance, fall prevention algorithm start-ups, in my opinion, have limited utility because we often know who the high-risk fallers are; the challenge lies in preventing the fall. CloudCath, on the other hand, stands out as the perfect start-up for early disease diagnosis. By detecting the early onset of sepsis in end-stage kidney disease patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, they ensure prompt treatment with empirical antibiotics, which are both cost-effective and easy to administer compared to septic shock that can occur if left untreated.


Lastly, in the realm of management, I don't envision the future of psychiatry relying heavily on mental health chatbots, as many people tend to undervalue solutions that don't involve direct interaction with a healthcare provider. However, there is considerable value in situations where skills need to be trained repeatedly to great effect. For instance, physiotherapy exercises are only as useful as AI can make them more effective, especially in terms of posture  correction and muscle activation. Speech therapy is an area with significant potential for disruption, as it is often expensive and requires consistent patient practice outside of clinical hours.

As an investor, I would likely look further in start-ups that focus on:
- Diagnosis of disease where it is easy to predict the outcome
- The intervention is cheap, accessible, and the consequences of missing the outcome are severe
- Management of diseases where skills need to be taught outside the confines of where providers can provide e.g. speech therapy, physical therapy
